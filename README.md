# 🌸 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flower species based on their features. It uses the famous **Iris dataset**, which contains measurements of sepal and petal length and width for three different species of iris flowers.

## 📌 What You'll Learn

- How to load and explore the Iris dataset
- How KNN works for classification problems
- How to train a model using `KNeighborsClassifier`
- How to evaluate model performance using accuracy
- How to visualize the data in 2D

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
- **Features**: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- **Target**: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Model Accuracy**: 100% on test data (using 80% training, 20% test split)

## 🔍 Visualization

The data was plotted using a 2D scatter plot to show how different classes cluster based on their features.

## 📂 Files

- `knn_iris.py`: Main code file that implements KNN on the Iris dataset
- `iris_plot.png`: Visualization of feature clustering

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `knn_iris.py` in your Python environment or Jupyter
3. View model accuracy and generated plots
